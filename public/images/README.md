# Images Directory

## Structure

- `profile.jpg` - Your profile photo (500x500px recommended)
- `logos/` - Community and company logos (200x200px recommended)

## Adding Images

1. **Profile Photo:** Add your photo as `profile.jpg` in this directory
2. **Logos:** Add PNG logos to the `logos/` subdirectory

## Tips

- Use square images for best results
- PNG format with transparency works best for logos
- Keep file sizes reasonable (<500KB per image)
- Use descriptive filenames in `logos/` folder
